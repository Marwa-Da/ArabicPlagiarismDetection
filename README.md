# Arabic Plagiarism Detection

Plagiarism Detection as was introduced in Khan H. et al. paper:
>Plagiarism is becoming a notorious problem in academic community. It occurs when someone
uses the work of another person without proper acknowledgement to the original source. The
plagiarism problem poses serious threats to academic integrity and with the advent of the Web,
manual detection of plagiarism has become almost impossible. Over past two decades, automatic
plagiarism detection has received significant attention in developing small- to large-scale
plagiarism detection systems as a possible countermeasure. Given a text document, the task of a
plagiarism detection system is to find if the document is copied partially or fully from other
documents from the Web or any other repository of documents.


In this project I try to find the plagiarism in AraPlagDet corpus(Arabic External Plagiarism Detection Corpus) following these steps:

1. Preprocessing the corpus text files.

2. Preprocessing the input text file (which the user wants to classify as plagiarised or not).

3. Query generation and submition.

4. Similarity computation.
